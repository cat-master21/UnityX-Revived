# Unityx from scratch

A fork of UnityX before it changed to a fork of Unity7. With this being primarilly from Fish + Python.
Currently a rewrite in Dash (fast Posix shell) is in progress.
## Wayland Progress
* [ ] Convert scripts to bash or Dash
* [ ] Use Wayfire
* [ ] Move away from Tint2 (`design/dock`) and use `nwg-panel`
* [ ] Convert settings to Zenity (Gtk4) from Python
* [ ] Use Pipewire (`keybindings/vol.sh`) instead of Pulseaudio
